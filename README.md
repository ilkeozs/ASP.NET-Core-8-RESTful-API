# ðŸŽ‰ Building RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core 8 ðŸŽ‰
This project showcases my journey of mastering modern, scalable, and maintainable Web API development using .NET 8. It is built upon the principles and best practices of professional API development.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
This repository contains a RESTful API developed with a focus on:  
- Scalability  
- Maintainability  
- Clean Code Practices  
- Real-world Implementation of Layered Architecture  

The project demonstrates the application of advanced API development techniques to create a robust and professional-grade solution.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights  
âœ… **Middleware**: Customizing and extending API functionalities to meet specific needs.  
âœ… **Caching**: Boosting performance by implementing efficient data caching techniques.  
âœ… **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**: Efficiently managing database operations with EF Core.  
âœ… **Error Handling & Logging**: Implementing robust error management and logging strategies to ensure smooth operations and traceability.  
âœ… **Identity Management (IDM)**: Mastering user authentication and authorization for secure access control.  
âœ… **Unit Testing & Mocking**: Writing and executing unit tests with mocking techniques to ensure code correctness and reliability.  
âœ… **Layered Architecture**: Using a Layered Architecture approach for better separation of concerns and maintainable code.  
âœ… **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Building flexible, decoupled, and testable applications by leveraging interfaces and dependency injection.  
âœ… **Validation**: Validating user input to ensure correctness, security, and robustness.  
âœ… **Generic Repository & Unit of Work**: Implementing these patterns to improve maintainability and reusability in data access layers.  
âœ… **Error Handling Middleware**: Developing custom middleware for centralized and efficient error handling across the API.  
âœ… **Docker Integration**: Containerizing applications with Docker for simplified deployment and environment management.  
âœ… **Clean Code Practices**: Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code using best practices.  
âœ… **Debugging**: Developing effective debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues quickly.
